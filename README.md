# simple-alerts for nodecg

This is WIP and not for use in production but you are welcome to help me finish it.

The goal is to be able to set up a multiple alerts for any purpose for live streams.
There will be multiple layouts and customisation options.
The alerts will be triggered/activated by other software/scripts using a rest API.
