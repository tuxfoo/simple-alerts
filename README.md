# simple-alerts for nodecg

This is WIP and not for use in production but you are welcome to help me finish it.

The goal is to be able to set up a multiple alerts for any purpose for live streams.
There will be multiple layouts and customisation options.
The alerts will be triggered/activated by other software/scripts using a rest API.

* Add a queue for the alerts.
* Add a "test" to the dashboard panel.
* Add a few different layouts
    * Media left, message center
    * media left, message center top

* Stop alert from playing when page loads.
* change duration from ms to seconds.
