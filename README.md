# simple-alerts for nodecg

This is WIP and not for use in production but you are welcome to help me finish it.

The goal is to be able to set up a multiple alerts for any purpose for live streams.
There will be multiple layouts and customisation options.
The alerts will be triggered/activated by other software/scripts using a rest API.

## known issues/To do

* Finish creating the API.
* Fix the issues in the panel.
    * Stop the alerts from duplicating when pressing submit.
    * Show the saved media file in the drop down menu after reloading page.
* Add a queue for the alerts.
* Add a "test" to the panel, prevent the alert's from displaying when the user presses submit.
* Add other media types (At the moment this only supports webm)
* Add a few diffent layouts
    * Media left, message center
    * media left, message center top
    * media left, message top left
    * media fullscreen, message center (This is currently the default)
